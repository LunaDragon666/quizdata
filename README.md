# Quiz Data üåê

## Project brief
I made a RESTful API with json and deployed this kind of database into the internet through Heroku for personal use on my own project work through internship at Framom. There is a plan to create several similar databases for further practice used on other, personal/freelance projects. In this particular case, I'm creating a small application for the agency I currently work at, where I'm preparing some kind of database for it that will be used when I'm going to create a quiz app for them. So far it has been tested in Vanilla JavaScript, but I also plan to test it out in the next possible React and/or Vue project.

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLnxgSZ0DG4&ab_channel=CodewithAniaKub%C3%B3w) to achieve exactly this as a starting point. Some changes to the database are to be expected, based on how this app is intended to work. 

## Details
Content inside the database is in my native language (norwegian), but since my databases are online, (future) APIs I create and this one I allow to be used for learning purposes only from now on. 

## Step-by-step
A quick tutorial about this process will come soon, also for me to repeat the procedure! Stay tuned üöÄ
